In this we are dealing with highly unbalanced dataset.
we can either oversample the data or undersample it but oversampling this won't help. so we undersampe it.
we have manually undersampled it we can also use predefined libraries like NearMiss .
Another dataset taken from kaggle with 1 lakh entries which is balanced. On this dataset i used one_hot of keras and word2vec for fearture extraction.
